#Wildfire Simulation
##Introduction
Using compute shaders and OpenGL, we implemented a new 3D wildfire simulation program. Using source landscape and heightmap textures, we read from the textures to generate and render the terrain mesh using tessellation.

Mesh instancing is then used to render the thousands of tree instances.

With the compute shader, we simulate the movement of wild fire via wind and different tree species.
